# Forward-Scan Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Code used for my degree project on simulataneous localization and mapping using an
fs-sonar.

NOTE: most branches are only experimental and might contain a lot of debug statements
and routines that may reduce the performance of the algorithms. The `exp_optimized` is the
most recent and thoroughly tested working version. Stick to that one!

Documentation (and a more meaningful README) is still on its way, but if you want to know more about the approach [here's the
link to my thesis!](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1507932&dswid=-2172)
